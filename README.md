# Aqil Hummatli — Learning by Building

I’m exploring software and systems with a structured, long-term approach.

I didn’t start with code. My background is in engineering and communication. I moved into programming by following logic, not trends — focusing on systems, tools, and thinking clearly.

## Mindset

- Learn by doing, not waiting to “get it all”
- Tools matter more than theories in the early phase
- Mistakes are part of building — not signs of failure
- Don’t over-organize in year one — reflect later, not upfront

---

## Current Focus

- Algorithms and C/C++  
- Backend logic and system design  
- Version control, shell scripting, and Linux workflows  
- Applying structured thinking to real tools
