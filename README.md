# Aqil Hummatli

Iâ€™m exploring software and systems with a structured, long-term approach.

My background is in engineering and communication. I moved into programming by following logic, not trends, focusing on systems, tools, and thinking clearly.

## Current Focus

- Algorithms and C/C++  
- Backend logic and system design
